Commit message: Add --no-mouse option to replace FZF_MOUSE_ENABLED
I went into the history of the commits where it showed all of the commits. From there, I control + F mouse until I found the exact commit
Adding Task 8
Task 6
------
In order to find the difference in the file when compared to the previous commit, use git diff.
Task 6: I used git --amend to change the commit message after I commited the original commit message
I used the rm command which removed the mistake.txt file from the directory
Task 9
Task 10: After I pushed the changes using 2 seperate commits, I used git revert in order to create a new commit that edits the files in the opposite way
